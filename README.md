## Note that this repo is no longer in use as I merged all 3 crates into the [main repo](https://github.com/Sagrel/lang)

This crate implements a simple language server for my lang. It uses this [boilerplate template](https://github.com/IWANABETHATGUY/tower-lsp-boilerplate).

The frontend for the language is implemented separatedly in [lang-frontend](https://github.com/Sagrel/lang-frontend).
